# - **Size and standard of training data**: The overall size of the training data for twemlab is 1625 and its aspect terms have been annotated by one individual "ad hoc" as per "Annotating Twemlab Goldstandard Files to Include Aspect Term Labels".</li>
# 
# - **Mearsuring performance**: a robust testing dataset is needed. Above, I have shown a makeshift performance measure on the same dataset that the model was trained on. Drawing any meaningful conclusions based on this is precarious.
# 
# - **Use different training data vs. annotate?** [SemEval2018 Task1 Affect in Tweets](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17751#learn_the_details-datasets) (anger: 1700, fear: 2200, joy: 1600, sadness: 1500)

# - **Training capacities**: Batch size reduced due to out-of-memory errors. GRACE training is memory intensive (the authors use a nvidia tesla v100 gpu). Potential options: reduce float point precision? Currently having issues installing conda package for apex to do so. 
# 
# #### Current Questions
# 
# - **Model optimisation**? The GRACE model uses GeLU (an "advanced" activation function), the standard BERT nn.embeddings layer, 12 transformer encoder layers and 2 decoder layers. On top of that it has two classification heads (both nn.Linear). During training the model uses additional functions for virtaul adversarial training and gradient harmonized loss calculation.
# 
# - **Transfer Learning**? Arguments for: fine-tuning is much more accurate than feature-extraction. And the most efficient way of fine-tuning a model that will likely need to be fine-tuned again and again is transfer learning (adapters)

# #### Potential Approach to Thesis
# 
# 
# **‚ÄúPitch‚Äù**
# 
# Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has garnered attention in recent years due to its fine-grained approach to sentiment analysis. ABSA enables sentiment analysis at the entity or aspect level, instead of the entire document, resulting in better insights. ABSA has four sub-tasks, each identifying a different token-level piece of information. While numerous models have been developed for ABSA, there are only a handful of methods that have been applied to social media (Twitter) data for aspect term and sentiment extraction.
# 
# However, current ABSA research has rarely explored the application of emotion detection for aspect-level sentiment analysis and it is not known that emotion detection has been applied to the End to End ABSA task. To date, there is also lacking research into the geographical distribution of emotions related to aspect terms. Additionally, there appears to be a lack of publicly available training data for aspect-level emotions on Twitter.
# 
# Therefore, the thesis aims to generate a publicly accessible dataset for aspect-level emotions and investigate whether a model optimized for social media end-to-end ABSA can be trained on this more fine-grained data with comparable accuracy. The thesis will also explore whether this fine-grained approach, coupled with geographical analysis, reveals deeper and more varied insights into public opinion on specific aspect terms. The hypothesis is that a geographical analysis of aspect-based emotions provides a more nuanced geospatial view of the otherwise simplified "negative" and "positive" labels.

# **Potential Research questions**
# 
# 1. Can a model optimised for social media end-to-end ABSA be trained on a more fine-grained set of emotions with comparable accuracy? 
# 2. How do the insights gained from analysing the emotions associated with aspect terms differ from those derived from traditional aspect-based sentiment analysis? (How can these insights be used to improve public opinion analysis?)
# 3. What new insights can be gained from analysing the geographical distribution of aspect-based emotions, and how can this be used to inform decision-making processes?
